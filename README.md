Paragraph abt graceful degradation and service workers:
Service workers support graceful degradation as they allow the user to still see a working app shell even if the network is slow or offline. It gives a fallback for when certain capabilities aren't available for all users (good connection in this case). It preserves the site's functionality and performance instead of immediately crashing.
